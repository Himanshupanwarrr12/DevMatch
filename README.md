DevMatch is an app designed for developers to connect with each other based on their skills. The goal is to help them find like-minded friends who can learn together or collaborate on building projects. Think of it as a "Tinder for developers" — but instead of dating, it’s about matching developers for skill-sharing and collaboration.
